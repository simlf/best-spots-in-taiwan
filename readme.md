## What is this?

A project to experiment some part of the MERN stack and create an API.

At 15 years old, I took a gap year and studied in one of the top taiwanese highschool for 10 months.

It was an awesome opportunity for me to discover the culture and the traditional Chinese language as I was hosted by locals.

It displays some of the best spots than you can find on Taiwan (according to my experience only). If you are planning to go there, hit me up!


The project is mainly coded using :
-> Node.js
-> Express.js
-> Mongo.DB
-> Pug.js

To create this project I followed courses from Wes Bos.
