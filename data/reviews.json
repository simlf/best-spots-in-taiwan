The scenery was like out of a story book. Pretty colours and the weather was perfect (winter time in December). The place was safe and you can take your time along the paths. The accommodation was also great, cosy and food was good enough. The peak was also pretty fun. Just make sure you travel light but with proper clothing. And I mean proper winter hiking clothing. No snow but temperatures can be really low depending on the weather. Overall this was one of my best hiking trips.","rating":5,"author":{"$oid":"5ea9be361c0fb6322564df73"},"spot":{"$oid":"5ea9dc98b1f8aa3e09e15713"},"created":{"$date":"2020-04-29T20:01:17.177Z"},"__v":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"5ea9ddb6b1f8aa3e09e15716"},"text":"This hike was too hard for me...
